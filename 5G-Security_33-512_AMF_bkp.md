## Introduction
This is a sample automated test suite for testing 5G Security test cases complying 3GPP 33.512. 
In this library, a 5G Security gets tested for features, functions & adherence to specifications of 3GPP.

A sample list of few test cases have been chosen for demonstrative purposes. 
Look into the topology to gather more details on nodes being emulated & likewise tested.

## Test Steps
* Login to Landslide
* Refer to the topology and pick the respective test case. 
* Determine the network connections and map the test cases to their respective ports such that every emulated network function and the node that is being tested is reachable. 
* Configure the desired test case & RUN them
* Observe the test case reported statistics to conclude on the test case behaviour and accodingly the criteria's defined to determine pass/fail criteria for a specific test case.
